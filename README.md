E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis (2024-2025)
Project Goal
I created this dashboard to turn raw sales data into business insights. Using a dataset of 5,000 orders, I focused on identifying which products drive the most profit and how different regions perform.

Key Insights
I built the dashboard in Tableau Public with a focus on these three areas:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
At the top of the page, I show Total Sales, Net Profit, and Profit Margin. I used custom formulas (Calculated Fields) to make sure these metrics update automatically when a user filters the data.

Sales & Profit Trends
I included a wide line chart to track growth over time. This helps the business see which months are the busiest and whether profit is staying steady as sales increase.

Profit Concentration (The Pareto Chart)
I created a wide chart that ranks every product sub-category by its profit. I added a "Cumulative" line to show the 80/20 Rule: how a small group of top-performing products actually generates the majority of the company's total wealth.

Skills Demonstrated
Data Visualization: Using Tableau to make complex data easy to understand.

Business Intelligence: Focusing on "Profit Concentration" to help a business prioritize its best products.

Interactivity: I added "Action Filters" so you can click on any region or category to update the entire dashboard instantly.

Technical Math: Writing custom code for metrics like Profit Margin % and Average Order Value.
